The number in parens is the number of matches played in that playlist this season.

- Copy `PlaylistRankViewerPlugin.dll` into the `plugins` folder and `playlistrankviewerplugin.set` into the `plugins/settings` folder
- Open the `cfg/plugins.cfg` file and add a new line to it: `plugin load playlistrankviewerplugin` and save it
